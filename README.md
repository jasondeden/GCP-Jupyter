# GCP-Jupyter

This is a collection of notebooks designed to accomplish certain things in GCP. Start with the Connect and Test instructions, which assume you've already installed and configured the SDK. There may be errors or omissions in steps - this is for fun and schoolwork and should not be used for business or production purposes without serious vetting.
